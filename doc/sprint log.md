## work log

### Sprint1

In sprint 1, we:

1. Evaluated requirements for tyrata simulator, did architecture design
2. Built coding environment
3. Worked on data generator module (including XML module)
4. Worked on a basic UI, built a plain one

Sprint1 workflow:

Time span: 2 weeks, 1st week for env build & design & implementation, 2nd week for integration & debug

After building coding env  

​	learned javaFX with Scenebuilder—> built a basic UI —> UI modification to support data generator & XML funcs

​	worked on data generator module : data structure design —> data generator implication —> unit test —> modification to support XML funcs

​	worked on XML parser <translate data from data generator to XML> : learn XML lib in java —> XML parser impletation —> unit test 

​	worked on saving XML to file : learn file lib & XML lib in java —> saving func implementation —> unit test

​	1st integration —> 1st component test & debug

### Sprint2

In sprint 2, we:

1. Focused on UI improvement  
2. Focused on bluetooth connection & transmission

Sprint2 workflow:

Time span: 3 weeks, 1st week for UI improvement & bluetooth connection, 2nd week for UI improvement & bluetooth connection & transmission, 3rd week for bluetooth transmission & test bluetooth transmission with android app  \ additional funcs (add random tires)

​	learned CSS  for UI improvement in javaFX —> UI improvement

​	searched for bluetooth lib in java: found *bluecove*—> learn bluecove by example —> prototype programming for connection —> prototype programming for transmission —> prototype test —> dealt with XML transmission —> implication —> component test & debug 

### Sprint3

In sprint 3, we:

1. Integrated bluetooth component into app
2. Additional funcs(random outlier interval)
3. Further UI improvement
4. system test & debug

Sprint3 workflow:

Time span: 2 weeks, 1st week for bluetooth component integration, 2nd week for further UI improvement & additional funcs & system test & debug & code refactoring
