# Sprint log

### Sprint1

In sprint 1, we:

1. Evaluated requirements for tyrata simulator, did architecture design
2. Deployed development Environment
3. Developed data generator model 
4. Built a functioning User Interface with control

Sprint1 workflow:

Time span: 2 weeks, 1st week for env build & design & implementation, 2nd week for integration & debug

After building coding env  

​	learned javaFX with Scenebuilder—> built a basic UI —> UI modification to support data generator & XML funcs

​	worked on data generator module : data structure design —> data generator implication —> unit test —> modification to support XML funcs

​	worked on XML parser <translate data from data generator to XML> : learn XML lib in java —> XML parser impletation —> unit test 

​	worked on saving XML to file : learn file lib & XML lib in java —> saving func implementation —> unit test

​	1st integration —> 1st component test & debug

### Sprint2

In sprint 2, we:

1. Re-designed User Interface
2. Implemented XML File Storage
3. Established bluetooth connection & transmission

Sprint2 workflow:

Time span: 3 weeks, 1st week for UI improvement & bluetooth connection, 2nd week for UI improvement & bluetooth connection & transmission, 3rd week for bluetooth transmission & test bluetooth transmission with android app  \ additional funcs (add random tires)

​	learned CSS  for UI improvement in javaFX —> UI improvement

​	searched for bluetooth lib in java: found *bluecove*—> learn bluecove by example —> prototype programming for connection —> prototype programming for transmission —> prototype test —> dealt with XML transmission —> implication —> component test & debug 

### Sprint3

In sprint 3, we:

1. Integrated bluetooth package into application
2. Modified Data Generating Algorithm (random outlier interval)
3. Improved User Interface Control (disable buttons for clarity, add help document link, etc.)
4. Performed code refactoring

Sprint3 workflow:

Time span: 2 weeks, 1st week for bluetooth component integration, 2nd week for further UI improvement & additional funcs & system test & debug & code refactoring

​	bluetooth component integration

​	further UI improvement

​	additional funcs

​	2nd integration —> 2ndcomponent test & debug —> system test & debug & code refactoring
