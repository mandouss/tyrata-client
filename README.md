# Sprint 2 TyrataSimulator 1.1.0

TyrataSimulator is a pc program that generates simulated Tyrata sensors output and transmits the data through Bluetooth.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project to Eclipse 
    `File` => `Import`, select `Git` => `Projects from Git`
2. Build the project and Run 


**Environment Requirement**

- Java SE 8 [1.8.0_162]
- Windows 10 (for Bluetooth to run)

## Tire Configuration

Upon launching, the program gives 4 default tires listed in a table. 

#### Edit Tires

Each tire comes with sensor ID, Location indicator, initial S11, install date, and tire pressure. 
Only initial S11 is used for computation, install date and tire pressure are listed for reference.

In the table, three actions are allowed: 

`Click` on a tire to see details, `double-click` to edit, and press `Delete` or `BackSpace` on keyboard to delete.

You can also do this using buttons on bottom-left screen:

`New` - Define a new tire

`Edit` - Edit parameters of a tire

`Delete` - Delete selected tire


#### Tire Configuration Reuse

If you wish to import or save the configuration, go to `menu bar` - `TireConfig` 

`Generate Tires` - yet to come

`Save` - Save the file to opened file path (path shown on the title)

`Save As` - Save the configuration as a new .xml file

`Import` - Import tire configuration from file system

## Data Generator 

4 parameters are required to generate simulation data: start date, time span, daily mileage, and ourlier interval (optional).

`Generate` - Generate Data

`Save` - Save the data as .xml file

`Show` - Show the data in UI

## Data Broadcast via Bluetooth

We successfully implemented Bluetooth connection seperately, and tested with Android app. 
Code can be found in dg.bluetooth package. UI interface for connection is also implemented. 
Integration into the main app will be completed in sprint 3. 

`Broadcast` - Start broadcasting (feedback info in the textFlow)

`Cancel` - Stop broadcasting (feedback info in the textFlow)


## Built with

- [JavaFX 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html) - GUI library for JAVA
- [Scene Builder 2.0](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-1x-archive-2199384.html) A Visual Layout Tool for JavaFX Applications
